‚ú® Pico & MicroPython Studies
This repository is a collection of my personal studies and projects using MicroPython. The primary goal is to explore the capabilities of MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico W and document the learning process, including hardware pinout and usage.

üíª Hardware Used
All projects in this repository are developed and tested exclusively on the Raspberry Pi Pico W. This board is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller with an RP2040 chip and integrated 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, making it an excellent platform for Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded applications.

üîå Pinout
The Raspberry Pi Pico W features a comprehensive set of GPIO pins. The pinout below highlights some of the most commonly used pins for general purpose input/output, PWM, I2C, SPI, and UART communication.

GP (GPIO) Pins: These are the general purpose digital pins.

ADC Pins (GP26-GP28): Used for analog-to-digital conversion, perfect for reading values from analog sensors.

3V3 (OUT): A 3.3V regulated power output.

VBUS: The 5V from the USB connection, great for powering external components.

GND: Ground pins.

üöÄ Getting Started
To use the code in this repository, you will need:

A Raspberry Pi Pico W board.

The official MicroPython firmware flashed onto your board.

A code editor like VS Code with the necessary MicroPython extensions.
